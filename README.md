# Game Boy Color IR3R53 chip

This repository has reverse-engineered schematics for the AMP-MGB (IR3R53) audio amplifier chip used in the Game Boy Color.

My [blog post](http://www.righto.com/2020/05/reverse-engineering-audio-chip-in.html) has more details and discussion of the chip.

I generated these schematics from John McMaster's [die photos](https://siliconpr0n.org/archive/doku.php?id=mcmaster:nintendo:ir3r53n-amp-mgb).
The schematics are hand-generated, so there may be errors; please let me know if you find any.

The component numbers on the schematics are non-consecutive. Numbers 0xx are for a headphone channel.
Numbers 1xx are for the speaker amp.
Numbers 2xx are shared between both headphone channels.
